# Design Patterns in Ruby

This project has detailed sample code (with my modification) for each pattern in the book [Design Patterns in Ruby](http://designpatternsinruby.com/). 
I also added important notes as comments. 

## Short summary of each pattern

### Template Pattern

Build an abstract base class with a skeletal method. This skeletal method (also called a template method) drives the bit of the processing that needs to vary, but it does so by making calls to abstract methods, which are then supplied by the concrete subclasses. 

### Strategy Pattern

Define a family of objects, the strategies, which all do the same thing. Not only does each strategy object perform the same job, but all of the objects support exactly the same interface.

### Observer Pattern

Create a clean interface between the source of the news (the observable object) and the consumer of that news (the observers), the Observer pattern moves the news without tangling things up. Ruby has a module [Observable](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/observer/rdoc/Observable.html)

### Composite Pattern

Build arbitrarily deep trees of objects in which we can treat any of the interior nodes - the composites - just like any of the leaf nodes.

### Iterator Pattern

Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. Check out [Enumerable](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Enumerable.html)

### Command Pattern

Factor out the action code into its own object. Useful for keeping a list of things to do and remembering what is already done so that we can undo or redo. Think [migrations in Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html) 

### Adapter Pattern

An adapter supports the inter- face that we need on the outside, but it implements that interface by making calls to an object hidden insideâ€”an object that does everything we need it to do, but does it via the wrong interface.

### Proxy Pattern

Proxies are the con artists of the programming world: They pretend to be some other object when they are not, in fact, that object. Inside the proxy is hidden a reference to the other, real object - an object that the GoF referred to as the subject.

### Decorator Pattern

Decorators are essentially shells: Each takes in a method call, adds its own special twist, and passes the call on to the next component in line. That next compo- nent may be another decorator, which adds yet another twist, or it may be the final, real object, which actually completes the basic request. Note the use of [Forwardable](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/forwardable/rdoc/Forwardable.html)

### Singleton Pattern

A class that can have only one instance and that provides global access to that one instance. Ruby has [Singleton](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.0/libdoc/singleton/rdoc/Singleton.html)

### Factory Pattern

Factory pattern is not really a new pattern at all. At its heart, this pattern is really just the Template Method pattern applied to the problem of creating new objects. Both patterns have a generic part, which is coded in the generic base class, and subclasses fill in the blanks left in the base class.
Abstract Factory is an object dedicated to creating a compatible set of objects. It's Strategy pattern applied to object creation.
