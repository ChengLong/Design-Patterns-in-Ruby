# Design Patterns in Ruby

This project has detailed sample code (with my modification) for each pattern in the book [Design Patterns in Ruby](http://designpatternsinruby.com/). 
I also add important notes as comments. 

## Short summary of each pattern

- *Template Pattern*: Build an abstract base class with a skeletal method. This skeletal method (also called a template method) drives the bit of the processing that needs to vary, but it does so by making calls to abstract methods, which are then supplied by the concrete subclasses. 
- *Strategy Pattern*: Define a family of objects, the strategies, which all do the same thing. Not only does each strategy object perform the same job, but all of the objects support exactly the same interface.
- *Observer Pattern*: Create a clean interface between the source of the news (the observable object) and the consumer of that news (the observers), the Observer pattern moves the news without tangling things up. Ruby has a module [Observable](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/observer/rdoc/Observable.html)
- *Composite Pattern*: Build arbitrarily deep trees of objects in which we can treat any of the interior nodes - the composites - just like any of the leaf nodes.
- *Iterator Pattern*: Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. Check out [Enumerable](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Enumerable.html)
- *Command Pattern*: Factor out the action code into its own object. Useful for keeping a list of things to do and remembering what is already done so that we can undo or redo. Think [migrations in Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html) 
- *Adapter Pattern*: An adapter supports the inter- face that we need on the outside, but it implements that interface by making calls to an object hidden insideâ€”an object that does everything we need it to do, but does it via the wrong interface.
